🏎️ F1 Race Outcome & Strategy Analyzer
An end-to-end Machine Learning project that analyzes historical Formula 1 race data to predict race finishing positions using a Random Forest Regressor.

The project covers the full ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and deployment using Flask with a simple interactive web interface.
